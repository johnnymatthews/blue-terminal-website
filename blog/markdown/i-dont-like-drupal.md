# I Don't Like Drupal

1. Want to find out with an inbuilt Drupal function does quickly? [Here's a massive wall of text about that one function you probably don't even need to know about anyway](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/api/entity-api/entity-metadata-wrappers).

2. Want to learn what a very heavily used function does? [Here's a Drupal forum post that was created 8 years ago and it woefully ineffective at explaining the problem at hand](https://www.drupal.org/node/541342).

3. Want to see which function/view/block/node/view/query is displaying a tiny little piece of front end HTML? [Here's a single answer post on the Drupal forums from 9 years ago](https://www.drupal.org/node/337350).

4. Want to change a single button name? Oh it's simple, you just have to do a global search in your project to find a small string of characters that you hope might be hardcoded, then go down the rabbit hole nine directories deep to make a hardcode change to a single variable because you can't reach those variables from anywhere else without having a PhD in Drupal studies.

5. Want a module that's up to date and frequently maintained? [Ha](https://www.drupal.org/project/devel_themer).
